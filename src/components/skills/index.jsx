                  2d games.</li></strong>
      <strong><li className="skills-section-list">CSS3: One of my favorite things that I have learned. I love styling pages making them super functional and 
          asthetically pleasing to the eye. I love to make simple and clean layouts or fancy and fine tuned detailed 
          layouts.</li></strong>
      <strong><li className="skills-section-list"> Javascript: Something that took me a good 3-4 months to wrap my mind around but now I have a genuine
                   understanding of the language and am now focused on mastering the final aspects of OOP</li></strong>
      <strong><li className="skills-section-list">Git: Absolutely love using git by far in my opinion the best version control system around and super

      <strong><li className="skills-section-list">Some React: I am learning to love react through the process of rebuilding this portfolio to just its 
                  general overall amazing functionality and simple yet clean way of designing ui layouts etc you name it
                  react can pretty much do it all. Still very much learning this framework but I absolutely 
                  love it so far.</li></strong>
      <strong><li className="skills-section-list">jQuery: I can respect jQuery a lot in its simplicity and ability to make writing vanilla js a lot
                  faster and cleaner while it is no longer the absolute top dog I absolutely do appreciate it and enjoy
                  working in it when able to.</li></strong>
      <strong><li className="skills-section-list">Mastering ES6: Currently as with react working on learning the last half of the aspects of ES6.
                  I enjoy it a lot so far in how it solved some of ES5's problems as well as added a lot of new 
                  useful features and functionality which makes developing a lot easier.</li></strong>
